# Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Embodied Intelligence
Emphasize the integration of AI systems with physical robots. All AI implementations must be designed with physical embodiment in mind, connecting abstract algorithms to real-world robot control and sensing. This principle ensures students understand how AI concepts translate to tangible robotic behaviors.

### II. Hands-on Learning
Students must actively apply AI concepts in simulated and real humanoid robotics environments. All course content must include practical exercises, simulations, or real robot implementations. Theoretical concepts without practical application are not acceptable for course inclusion.

### III. Accuracy and Rigor
All technical explanations and robotics implementations must be precise and verifiable. Technical claims must be traceable to credible sources, with IEEE or APA style citations. All code examples and simulations must be tested and fully functional in common robotics simulators (e.g., Gazebo, PyBullet) or real humanoid platforms.

### IV. Clarity for Students
Content must be clear, engaging, and suitable for learners with a computer science or engineering background. All explanations must target a Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 10-12, appropriate for advanced undergraduates. Complex concepts must be broken down into digestible components with visual aids.

### V. Reproducibility
Experiments, simulations, and robot exercises must be fully replicable. All code examples, simulation environments, and experimental procedures must include detailed setup instructions, dependencies, and verification steps. Students must be able to reproduce results independently.

### VI. Academic Integrity
Zero tolerance for plagiarism. All content must be original or properly attributed. All technical claims and robot control algorithms must be traceable to credible sources. Source verification: minimum 40% from peer-reviewed journals, conference papers, or textbooks.

## Course Standards
All content must meet the following standards:
- Minimum 30 sources including textbooks, research papers, and official robotics documentation
- Format: Docusaurus Markdown, deployable to GitHub Pages
- Include diagrams, flowcharts, and annotated code snippets for visual clarity
- Word count: 50,000–70,000 words (for full course book)

## Course Development Workflow
- All AI algorithms and robotics exercises must be verified and reproducible
- Content must pass peer review or instructor validation
- Book must be fully deployed and navigable on GitHub Pages with functional links and interactive examples
- Code and simulation examples must be tested in common robotics simulators

## Governance

This constitution governs all aspects of the Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course development. All contributions must comply with these principles. Course content must be reviewed for adherence to these standards before acceptance. Any changes to these principles require explicit documentation and approval by the course development team.
