## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully generated tasks.md for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. The tasks are organized into 7 phases:

1. Phase 1: Setup Tasks - Initialize Docusaurus project structure
2. Phase 2: Foundational Tasks - Create core textbook infrastructure
3. Phase 3: User Story 1 [P1] - Module 1 content on ROS 2
4. Phase 4: User Story 2 [P2] - Module 2 content on Digital Twin
5. Phase 5: User Story 3 [P3] - Module 3 content on AI-Robot Brain
6. Phase 6: User Story 4 [P4] - Module 4 content on VLA systems
7. Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting - Final validation and deployment

The tasks follow the required checklist format with proper Task IDs, story labels, and file paths. Each user story has independent test criteria and can be implemented/tested independently. Parallel execution opportunities are marked with [P] tags. The implementation strategy focuses on MVP delivery with Module 1 as the initial scope.
