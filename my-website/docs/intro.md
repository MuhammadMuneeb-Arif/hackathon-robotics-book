# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This comprehensive guide explores the fascinating intersection of artificial intelligence and embodied robotics, where digital intelligence meets physical reality through humanoid robots.

## Course Overview

The future of AI expands into the physical world. This course introduces Physical AI—AI systems that operate under physics, interact naturally with humans, and control humanoid robots. Students will use industry-standard tools including ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac to build advanced embodied intelligence systems.

## What You'll Learn

This textbook is structured into four comprehensive modules that build upon each other to provide a complete understanding of humanoid robotics:

1. **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**: Understand distributed robot control frameworks, build ROS 2 nodes for motors, sensors, and behaviors, and design URDF-based humanoid robot models.

2. **The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)**: Run robot simulations for locomotion and balance, test perception systems in virtual worlds, and create realistic physics-based environments.

3. **The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)**: Train humanoid perception models with Isaac, use Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) for navigation and mapping, and implement advanced perception pipelines.

4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Build voice-to-action pipelines, integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) for humanoid instruction following, and create cognitive planning systems.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this textbook, students should have:
- Basic programming experience in Python
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Linux/Ubuntu environment
- Basic knowledge of linear algebra and calculus

## Learning Approach

Each lesson in this textbook follows a hands-on learning approach with:
- Clear learning objectives at the beginning of each lesson
- Practical exercises to reinforce concepts
- Key takeaways to summarize important points
- Reflection questions to deepen understanding
- Code examples in Python for ROS 2, Isaac, and simulation
- APA-formatted citations for technical accuracy

## Hardware and Software Requirements

The course includes detailed requirements for:
- Digital twin workstations (NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti minimum, 64GB RAM, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
- Edge computing kits (Jetson Orin Nano or NX)
- Sensor packages (RealSense cameras, IMU sensors)
- Optional robot platforms (Unitree Go2 Edu, Unitree G1)

## Course Structure

The textbook follows a 13-week quarterly breakdown:
- Weeks 1–2: Introduction to Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence
- Weeks 3–5: ROS 2 Fundamentals & Robot Modeling
- Weeks 6–7: Gazebo Simulation & Unity Visualization
- Weeks 8–10: NVIDIA Isaac Perception & Control
- Weeks 11–12: Humanoid Locomotion, Kinematics, Interaction
- Week 13: Conversational & VLA Robotics

## Capstone Project

The course culminates in "The Autonomous Humanoid" capstone project, where students build a simulated humanoid robot that listens to voice commands, plans actions using LLMs, navigates obstacles with Nav2, identifies objects using computer vision, and manipulates them in simulation.

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to establish the foundational understanding of ROS 2, then progress through each module sequentially. The content is designed to be accessible to beginner-to-intermediate learners with step-by-step explanations and practical examples.

Let's begin this exciting journey into the world of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics!
